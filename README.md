# Image-Caption-Generation
This is the CW2 of AI on Colab with seq2seq (CNN+RNN/LSTM) and Flickr8k dataset.

## Tasks:
1. text preprocess - convert to lowercase, remove any punctuation, remove infrequently used words.

2. BLEU for evaluation - use BLEU to evaluate the quality of generated captions.

3. Compare lemmatized vs regular tokens.

4. Compare training using an RNN vs LSTM for the decoder network (loss, BLEU scores over test set, quality of generated captions, performance on long captions vs. short captions, etc.)
